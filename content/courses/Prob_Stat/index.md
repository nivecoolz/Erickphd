Description of Course Content:

Topics in engineering that involve random processes. Applications and backgrounds for topics in reliability, inventory systems, and queuing problems, including absolute and conditional prob- abilities, discrete and continuous random variables, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and an introduction to linear regression. This course will also introduce basic programming skills and applications for statistical analyses using R and the tidyverse as well spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets).

Student Learning Outcomes:

At the end of this course students should be able to (1) understand the basic concepts of probability theory and hypothesis testing, (2) apply those concepts to solving numerical problems, especially those relating to probability distributions, (3) collect data and perform descriptive and inferential statistical analyses, (4) use a programming language and/or other software to perform statistical analyses.
