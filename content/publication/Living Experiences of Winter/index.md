Abstract:

TEPRIâ€™s research analyst, Andrew Robison, presented the key findings from the July report, When the Lone Star Froze Over: Winter Storm Uri and the lived experiences of Texas low-income communities, at the Behavior, Energy and Climate Conference (BECC) on Tuesday, November 9th, 2021. The presentation focused on the lived experiences of low-income Texans before, during, and after Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, examined the lasting effects of the storm on low-income populations, and discussed the policy and regulatory changes that have occurred since.

The BECC Conference is convened by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), California Institute for Energy and Environment (CIEE) within the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at U.C. Berkeley, and the Environmental and Energy Policy Analysis Center (SEEPAC) at Stanford University.
