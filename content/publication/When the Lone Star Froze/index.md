Abstract:

Although Winter Storm Uri hit Texas over five months ago, its lingering impacts continue to affect households across the state, inform political discourse, and bring attention to ERCOT and the Texas energy market. In March we released The Lived Experiences of Winter Storm Uri, a blog post that presented some of the high-level insights of a survey of nearly 1,000 Texans who had lived through the winter storm. Since that point, there have been several salient policy updates that have informed the interpretation and analysis of the data collected in that survey.

As a follow up to our March blog post, we are now excited to present When the Lone Star Froze Over â€“ Winter Storm Uri and the lived experiences of Texas low-income communities. This report provides an overview of the electricity conditions during the winter storm, provides an update of the regulatory and policy updates that have occurred since February, and provides further context of the lived experiences of lower-income Texas households before, during, and immediately following Winter Storm Uri. We hope that this report will serve to highlight how lower-income households across the state were particularly impacted by the storm and how these impacts add to economic and personal strain from existing energy burdens and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

For inquiries about this report, please contact TEPRI Research Analyst Andrew Robison, author of this report.
