Abstract:

CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is a climate change mitigation strategy aimed at reducing the amount of CO vented into the atmosphere by capturing CO2 emissions from industrial sources, transporting the CO2 via a dedicated pipeline network, and injecting it into geologic reservoirs. Designing CCS infrastructure is a complex problem requiring concurrent optimization of source selection, reservoir selection, and pipeline routing decisions. Current CCS infrastructure design methods assume that project parameters including costs, capacities, and availability, remain constant throughout the projectâ€™s lifespan. In this research, we introduce a novel, multi-phased, CCS infrastructure design model that allows for analysis of more complex scenarios that allow for variations in project parameters across distinct phases. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with theoretical analysis and an evaluation using real CCS infrastructure data.
