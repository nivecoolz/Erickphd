  Erick spent several years working in the design, manufacturing, oil and gas, and HVAC industries. During this time, he traveled around the world and witnessed how basic infrastructure like electricity, HVAC systems, clean water, internet, and banking where lacking and dramatically affected quality of life for the majority of the world's population. These experiences motivated Erick to pursue research that can enhance quality of life by improving access to sustainable resources and economic opportunities, particularly where a lack of physical infrastructure or economic resources presents a major obstacle.

  He has worked with the Texas Energy Poverty Research Institute, Los Alamos National Labs, Carbon Solutions, the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, and the Houston Health Department. Furthermore, Erick believes in diversity of thought, the power of support from policies and organizations, and the necessity of inclusion and awareness and has participated in various education and outreach activities like the All-Earth EcoBot Challenge, Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day, and NSBE's Walk for Education.

  Erick's teaching philosophy is based on an active learning approach and utilizes project-based collaborative learning techniques. This creates a more inclusive classroom where students can learn from each other's strengths improving student outcomes especially underrepresented minorities and woman in engineering. He built this teaching philosophy with experiences as a TA, a Scientist in Residence, and grader for Engineer Your World. His teaching experience, industry experience, and educational background qualify him to teach in areas related to the theory and applications of optimization and simulation modeling, the theory and application of economic and statistical modeling, and foundational engineering science and applications.

  In his research, Erick is committed to finding ways to cost effectively design, build, and operate sustainable, healthy, and social communities, in both urban and rural environments.

  He investigates key questions regarding emerging trends and technologies, the interplays between the macro and systems level, how the Internet of Things (IoT) and new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can help create more accurate digital models, and how to use those models to control physical systems with tools like digital twins. I typically use a multi-systems optimization modeling approach, but have used other methods like regression, machine learning, systems dynamics, and agent-based modeling simulation techniques.

  He plans to create a lab that: 1) Runs large-scale experiments on distributed systems (e.g., solar and RWH), smart buildings, net-zero homes, autonomous transportation, and electric vehicle charging. 2) Has servers that can run computationally expensive optimization and simulation models, perform data analytics, monitor and control connected devices, and store large amounts of data; 3) Has IoT and ICT devices like RFID and smart meters to generate data and monitor research activities; 4) Production, inventory control, supply chain, and logistics equipment such as 3D printers and a conveyor system.
