Welcome to webpage for the SEAR lab run by Dr. Erick C. Jones Jr.

We are committed to finding ways to cost effectively design, build, and operate sustainable, healthy, and social communities, in both urban and rural environments.

We are currently **looking for motivated students** to work on a variety of projects!!! See postings below.
