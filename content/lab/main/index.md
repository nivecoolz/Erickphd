<h1> <i class='fas fa-laptop-code'></i> SEAR labs Mission, Vision, and Methods</h1>

<p><strong>Vision:</strong> The SEAR or Sustainable and Equitable Allocation of Resources Lab believes that by creating systems that properly allocate resources, we can sustainably, equitably, and resiliently meet society's needs for food, energy, and water while maintaining a high standard of living.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> The SEAR or Sustainable and Equitable Allocation of Resources lab investigates how communities, companies, and countries can allocate their limited resources in a way that maximizes their desired outcomes in a sustainable, equitable, and resilient but also elegant way.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> We assess these problems by combining physical experimentation, data analytics, and stochastic systems optimization to provide actionable decisions and/or create scalable prototypes.</p>
</ul>

<h1> <i class='fas fa-chalkboard-teacher'></i>Techniques and Lab Capabilities</h1>

  We typically use a multi-systems optimization modeling approach, but have used other methods like regression, machine learning, systems dynamics, and agent-based modeling simulation techniques.

<br><br>  We are currently building our lab so that we can: 
  
<ol>
<li>Run large-scale experiments on distributed systems (e.g., solar and RWH), smart buildings, net-zero homes, autonomous transportation, and electric vehicle charging. </li>
<li>Have servers that can run computationally expensive optimization and simulation models, perform data analytics, monitor and control connected devices, and store large amounts of data; </li>
<li>Have IoT and ICT devices like RFID and smart meters to generate data and monitor research activities;</li>
<li>Have production, inventory control, supply chain, and logistics equipment such as 3D printers and a conveyor system.</li>
</ol>
