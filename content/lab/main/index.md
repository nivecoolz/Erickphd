<h1> <i class='fas fa-laptop-code'></i> Overview</h1>

We investigate key questions regarding emerging trends and technologies such as:
<ul>
<li>The interplays between the macro and systems level</li>
<li>How the Internet of Things (IoT) and new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can help create more accurate digital models</li>
<li>How to use those models to control physical systems with tools like digital twins. </li>
</ul>

For more information please look at our <a href='/publication/'> publications </a>.

<h1> <i class='fas fa-chalkboard-teacher'></i>Techniques and Lab Capabilities</h1>

  We typically use a multi-systems optimization modeling approach, but have used other methods like regression, machine learning, systems dynamics, and agent-based modeling simulation techniques.

<br><br>  We are currently building our lab so that we can: 
  
<ol>
<li>Run large-scale experiments on distributed systems (e.g., solar and RWH), smart buildings, net-zero homes, autonomous transportation, and electric vehicle charging. </li>
<li>Have servers that can run computationally expensive optimization and simulation models, perform data analytics, monitor and control connected devices, and store large amounts of data; </li>
<li>Have IoT and ICT devices like RFID and smart meters to generate data and monitor research activities;</li>
<li>Have production, inventory control, supply chain, and logistics equipment such as 3D printers and a conveyor system.</li>
</ol>
