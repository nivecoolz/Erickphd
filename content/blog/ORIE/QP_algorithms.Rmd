This post explores how to solve QPs by hand and with Gurobi. 
I have written these using Gurobi as a solver and as the mathematical formulation software.
This is a reproducible example if you have R Studio just  make sure you have installed the correct packages.





```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE)


```

```{r libraries2load, results= 'hide'}
library(gurobi)
library(tictoc)
library(Matrix)
library(ggplot2)
#library(matlib)
library(MASS)
```

Gradient Descent a first order method $x_{i+1} = x_i + \lambda*d/f(x)$

```{r gradient_descent_example}


x <- c(-10:10)
fx1 <- x^2
xi <- 10
lambda <- 0.2
xit <- xi

fx <- xit^2
dfx <- 2*xit

gd <- data.frame('x' = xit, 'fx' = fx, 'dfx' = dfx)



while(dfx < -10^-50 | dfx > 10^-50){
xit <- xit - lambda*dfx
fx <- xit^2
dfx <- 2*xit
gd <- rbind(gd, c(xit,fx,dfx))

}

head(gd)
tail(gd)

qplot(x = x, y = fx1)
qplot(x,fx, data = gd)
```


```{r, include= FALSE}
rm(x,fx1,xi,xit,lambda,dfx,fx,gd)

```

standard form for quadratics

$min\: z; z = -8x_1-16x_2+x_1^2+4x_2^2$

s.t. 
$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 5$ 
$x_1 + x_4 = 3$

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
