Welcome to the site of a Texas born, raised, and trained academic working to make the world a better place through engineering and innovation. <br>

<br> I currently research, teach, and serve in the Industrial, Manufacturing, and Systems Engineering department at The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). UTA is located in Arlington, the entertainment capital of Texas, home to the Dallas Cowboys and Six Flags, and the 2026 World Cup.<br>
  
<br>My current research interests include investigating how the new technologies impact critical supply chains, future innovations, and people's standards of living. My lab, the Sustainable and Equitable Allocation of Resources or SEAR lab, and the people in it combine physical experimentation and multi-systems optimization modeling to evaluate research questions related to energy, supply chains, transportation, climate change, and more. <br>

<br>Lastly, I enjoy exploring cities on my ebike, visiting parks and museums, playing sports, card, and board games, traveling, and drone photography.<br>
