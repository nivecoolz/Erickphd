Welcome to the site of a Texas born, raised, and trained academic looking to make the world a better place through engineering and innovation. <br>

<br> I currently teach Engineering Probability and Statistics at <a href='https://uta.edu/ie'>The University of Texas at Arlington</a> in the entertainment capital of Texas, Arlington home to the Dallas Cowboys and the Texas Rangers. <br>
  
<br>I am committed to finding ways to cost effectively design, build, and operate sustainable, healthy, and social communities, in both urban and rural environments. <br>

<br>My current research interests include investigating key questions regarding emerging trends and technologies, the interplays between the macro and systems level, how the Internet of Things (IoT) and new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can help create more accurate digital models, and how to use those models to control physical systems with tools like digital twins. I typically use a multi-systems optimization modeling approach, but have used other methods like regression, machine learning, systems dynamics, and agent-based modeling simulation techniques.<br>

<br>My personal interests include exploring parks, museums, sports, card and board games, traveling, and drone photography.<br>
