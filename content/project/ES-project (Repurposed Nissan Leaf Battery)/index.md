EVs are a newer technology, and their batteries require different end-of-life processing than gasoline vehicles. Luckily, lithium-ion battery recycling research and development has been going on for years and there is an existing and growing repurposing and recycling system in North America for these components.

Abstract:
EVs are a newer technology, and their batteries require different end-of-life processing than gasoline vehicles. Luckily, lithium-ion battery recycling research and development has been going on for years and there is an existing and growing repurposing and recycling system in North America for these components.
As these batteries can still hold up to 70% of their rated capacity before they are sent for recycling, they can be repurposed to powerhouses. We can use them to store the energy generated by renewables such as solar and wind. We can call this the second life of the EV batteries
