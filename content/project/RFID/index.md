RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) uses radio waves to communicate information between a reader and an objectâ€™s RFID tag. This technology can track information and objects in research, surgical, energy, security, and supply chain environments. We aim to identify and resolve RFID issues and expand what RFIDs can do. Below is a list of our facilities, capabilities, and work that have been published.
Alien Readers and Software
Zebra Tags and Printers
Impinj Readers and Software
Clear Stream Database Software
Custom Medical Grade RFID Tags
Real Time Location Sensing (RTLS) with Ubisense
