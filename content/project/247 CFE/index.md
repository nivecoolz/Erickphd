This is a new project that aims to investigate how 24/7 Carbon Free Energy (CFE) would work and how to optimize for it. Current plans include modeling it with OSeMOSYS or SWITCH.


24/7 Carbon-free Energy (CFE) means that every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumption is met with carbon-free electricity sources, every hour of every day, everywhere. It is both the end state of a fully decarbonized electricity system, and a transformative approach to energy procurement, supply, and policy design that is critical to accelerating its arrival.
