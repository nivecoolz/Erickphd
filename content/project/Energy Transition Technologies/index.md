At the end of the limited life span of solar panels and batteries (20-25 years and 10 years, respectively), they are often thrown away instead of being recycled by homeowners/manufacturers. Improper disposal is an environmental problem because panels and batteries leak harmful chemicals into landfills.


We plan to repurpose panels and batteries while focusing on underrepresented areas in the energy transition. Novice installers will be trained and able to use their training in other capacities, thus giving locals more career opportunities. This project aims to improve the solar supply chain, test the degradation rate of panels, and monitor the resilience of these used panels in extreme weather.
