This project investigates we can optimize the entire green building process from design, construction, and operations. We currently plan to create 3D BIM models and run them through EnergyPlus to determine the most efficient designs, build them in collaboration with the UTA Community Design-Build Studio, and monitor their operations with sensors.

Collaborators:

Charles MacBride, UTA Architecture Department
June Young Park, UTA Civil Engineering Department
