Agriculture modeling is essential to the continued development of our farmable resources. Properly maintaining the quality of these urban and rural systems should prove important as better technologies develop in our country.

Therefore, we developed a framework for farm investment decisions structured as a two-stage stochastic quadratically constrained linear program that maximizes farm profit over 25 years while considering an uncertain future climate and the costs of investing and operating various electricity and water technologies. We continue to work with Restorative Farms, an organization that seeks to create self-sustaining farm systems and provide job opportunities, to track their supply chain and report on its effectiveness. We also currently work with Urban Roots System, a non-profit that provides youth leaders with paid opportunities to grow food and create communities, to improve their organization.
