Engaging with youth and providing them with opportunities, especially from diverse populations, is necessary to guarantee a well-rounded outcome for all students.

The workshop seeks to develop national strategies and key recommendations to engage groups currently under-served in the geosciences, including students from key geographic areas and at institutions that serve economically and demographically diverse populations. The workshop effort seeks to support students to pursue graduate degrees in geosciences by learning about methods that could increase the likelihood of successful applications for Federal graduate fellowships. The project aims to create an initial model for geosciences that can be tested with and applied to other STEM disciplines. The project will also elucidate the data needed to provide an evidence-based understanding of the impacts of different funding mechanisms, especially federal graduate fellowships, on graduate student recruitment, retention and workforce outcomes.
