Sustainable Building Design seeks to provide green and renewable infrastructure into traditional buildings. With this concept, we aim to design buildings that obtain and contribute to renewable energy as well as eliminating unnecessary emissions.

This project investigates how we can optimize the entire green building process from design, construction, and operations. We plan to create 3D BIM models and run them through EnergyPlus to determine the most efficient designs, build them in collaboration with the UTA Community Design-Build Studio, and monitor their operations with sensors.

The project involves synthesizing and analyzing existing literature and data, including publicly available and proprietary datasets, to develop a clear understanding of the Energy Affordability Gap (EAG) and the energy efficiency and rooftop solar potential of the existing affordable housing stock. This project also involves stakeholder meetings in Houston with local community organizations, researchers, energy providers, and local leadership to identify barriers and develop solutions specific to Harris County, opportunities to leverage funding sources, and alignment with the City of Houston Climate Action Plan.
