Geographical information systems create, analyze, map, and manage data from different points on Earth. GIS is used for things like infrastructure and topographical information for various regions.
The study aims to analyze the spatial relationship between critical infrastructure and socioeconomics in Texas cities, identify at-risk areas, and develop effective emergency response strategies. It also focuses on analyzing the connectivity of Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) in different census regions through various modes of transportation, identifying areas that require infrastructure upgrades. The goal is to understand the complex relationship between critical infrastructure, emergency response, and transportation infrastructure in Texas cities and inform policy decisions to address disparities and improve connectivity.
