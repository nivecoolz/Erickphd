Creating hybrid energy storage modules is key to providing high energy and high power systems that some energy storage modules do not offer. Providing a high amount of power for an extended period of time could prove useful in future endeavors with breakthrough technologies.

This proposal will provide students from underrepresented groups who are majoring in Electrical Engineering (EE), Industrial, Manufacturing, and Systems Engineering (IMSE), Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), and Mechanical Engineering (ME) with the opportunity to perform analytical and experimental research that will advance the state-of-the-art of distributed generation power systems. It encompasses overlapping technical areas of critical interest to the US Department of Defense (DoD) and the US future Joint Force, including power systems engineering, power generation, pulsed power, directed energy, controls, energy storage, and system engineering. COSMOS researchers have data science expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, mathematical programming, stochastic optimization, discrete-event and agent-based simulation modeling, design of experiments, statistical modeling, and statistical process monitoring. SAVII applications have a specific focus on energy systems that, paired with COSMOS resources, will be an asset to the proposal.
