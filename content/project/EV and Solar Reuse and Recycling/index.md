Electric vehicles are at the center of discussion and research as our planet reaches a time of crisis regarding the climate and our infrastructure. Maintaining the environment by reusing materials we already own can address climate issues.

The Nissan Leaf is one of the first mass-produced EVs, and many of these vehicles are reaching their end of life. However, their battery packs could be recycled and used for other purposes. To ensure its usefulness, we need to test the charge and discharge properties of the battery pack system. A DC bench power supply is a widely used tool for evaluating the efficiency and functionality of electric vehicle batteries. By the end of this report, we gain an improved understanding of how to effectively charge and discharge the Nissan Leaf battery using a DC bench power supply and the benefits of doing so.
