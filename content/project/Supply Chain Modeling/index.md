Many companies struggle with justifying the cost of quality within their supply chain. Outsourcing suppliers to countries such as China has become popular in recent years because it appears to be more profitable. These outsourced decisions do not effectively determine the impacts of quality defects.

We demonstrate a method for evaluating the systemic supply chain risk of poor quality. We introduce a multi-objective stochastic model that uses Six Sigma measures to evaluate financial risk.
