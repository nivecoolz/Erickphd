The primary goal of this project is to help improve the SimCCS CCS infrastructure optimization framework. SimCCS is used to develop fossil-related infrastructure through dedicated pipelines. To date SimCCS has been principally applied to CO2 capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure, though the software’s pipeline routing could be applied to any pipeline product including oil and natural gas. This is closely aligned with Office of Fossil Energy’s mission to help the United States meet its continually growing need for secure, reasonably priced and environmentally sound fossil energy supplies.

The key objective is to enhance the SimCCS framework through a combination of one or more of software development/coding, graphical user interface (GUI) enhancement, case study development and data collection and visualization, user testing, and conceptual model development. We wish to investigate the 45Q credits and as such need to modify the SimCCS 2.0 framework to optimize different time periods. Adding temporal variation to SimCCS will raise unforeseen challenges but allow us to investigate new challenging problems.

Erick C. Jones Jr. started this project as a Mickey Leland Energy Fellow and any student who followed in his footsteps would be working alongside a dynamic team based in Los Alamos National Labs with a wide range of backgrounds including computer science, geosciences (e.g., geography, geology), and petroleum engineering.
