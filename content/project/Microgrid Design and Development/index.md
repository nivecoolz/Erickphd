Microgrids are local and small electrical grids that can be operated independently of a large-scale power grid. Because of this, engineers must design microgrids effectively so that their function contributes to society and the environment rather than inhibiting them.

This research addresses the two biggest concerns surrounding electricity: reliability and sustainability. Since we are quickly depleting the finite fossil fuels we rely on for electricity production, the goal is to develop a microgrid that runs on renewable energy, efficiently stores energy, and is made with affordable materials. Not only do we want to design environmentally conscious microgrids, but we also want to develop generalized and adaptable microgrids to maximize reliability and sustainability. Through our research, we identify the four main components of a microgrid to determine the best way to design and improve microgrids through the lens of scalability, affordability, and efficiency. One major design implementation we make is repurposing battery cells from a Nissan Leaf electric vehicleâ€”this keeps the batteries out of landfills and gives them a longer life.
