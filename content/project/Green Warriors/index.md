This project aims to create a new program that can aid in the current Weatherization Assistance Program for Dallas. We aim to train a workforce to implement shallow retrofits and prepare homes for the full weatherization program. Furthermore, we want to use data analytics to compare energy usage before upgrades to those immediately afterwords. 
Collaborators:

Tracy Wallace, Green Careers Dallas
