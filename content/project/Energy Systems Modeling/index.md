Energy Systems Modeling is a way of computer modeling different types of energy systems to solve various energy-related issues or crises. Models often use scenario-based equations that analyze different assumptions about the specific conditions that factor into the energy systems themselves. 

The OSeMOSYS Modeling style identifies the optimal conditions for renewable energy sources that may reduce costs and CO2 emissions. The article details how SAV popularization has contributed to climate change and the climate crisis, ultimately helping aid the fight to keep our climate healthy.
