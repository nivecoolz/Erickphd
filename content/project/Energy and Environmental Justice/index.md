Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD) uses income, energy expenses, fuel type, and housing information for energy use data for low-income households. When we better understand these factors, we can better serve communities experiencing high energy burdens that outweigh their income. Federal and local governments and other organizations use data to address the issue of low-income households spending much of their income on energy-related expenses. The data needed, however, isnâ€™t always available or is limited. LEAD will provide these organizations with the appropriate information to assist underserved communities.
